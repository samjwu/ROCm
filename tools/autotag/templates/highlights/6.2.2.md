## Release highlights

The following is a significant fix introduced in ROCm 6.2.2.

### Fixed Instinct MI300X error recovery failure

Improved the reliability of AMD Instinct MI300X accelerators in scenarios involving
uncorrectable errors. Previously, error recovery did not occur as expected,
potentially leaving the system in an undefined state. This fix ensures that error
recovery functions as expected, maintaining system stability.

See the [original issue](#instinct-mi300x-gpu-recovery-failure-on-uncorrectable-errors)
noted in the ROCm 6.2.1 release notes.
