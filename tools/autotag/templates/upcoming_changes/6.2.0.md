## ROCm upcoming changes

The section notes upcoming changes to the ROCm software stack. For upcoming changes related to individual components, review
the [Detailed component changes](detailed-component-changes).

### rocm-llvm-alt

The `rocm-llvm-alt` package will be removed in an upcoming release. Users relying on the
functionality provided by the closed-source compiler should transition to the open-source compiler.
Once the `rocm-llvm-alt` package is removed, any compilation requesting functionality provided by
the closed-source compiler will result in a Clang warning: "*[AMD] proprietary optimization compiler
has been removed*".
