## ROCm upcoming changes

The following changes to the ROCm software stack are anticipated for future releases.

### rocm-llvm-alt

The `rocm-llvm-alt` package will be removed in an upcoming release. Users relying on the functionality provided by the closed-source compiler should transition to the open-source compiler. Once the `rocm-llvm-alt` package is removed, any compilation requesting functionality provided by the closed-source compiler will result in a Clang warning: "*[AMD] proprietary optimization compiler has been removed*".

### rccl-rdma-sharp-plugins

The RCCL plugin package, `rccl-rdma-sharp-plugins`, will be removed in an upcoming ROCm release.
